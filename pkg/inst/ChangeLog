Version 3.10
    o Major rewrite of the core C code, to prevent any possible memory leaks
      and segmentation faults
    o New: argument "max.comb" in function minimize(), to limit the size of the
      PI chart to the number of PIs at that complexity level where the possible
      number of combinations does not exceed a maximum value
    o New: argument "first.min" in function minimize(), to return the very first
      minimal model found, provided the PI chart can be solved
    o Changed: argument "min.pin" no longer cares if the PIs at the next
      level of complexity contribute or not to the number of minimal models;
      instead, it strictly returns the PIs at the first level of complexity
      where the PI chart can be minimally solved
    o New: arguments "max.comb" and "first.min" in function solveChart(), to
      mirror those from function minimize()
      
Version 3.9
    o Function export() moved to package admisc
    o Fixed: row numbers bigger than the total number of rows in a truth
      table are now ignored from the "exclude" argument
      (thanks to Philipp Bentz for the report)
    o Fixed: minor bug diplaying additional parameters of fit in function pof()
    o Changed: function minimize() no longer returns with an error when 
      including remainders on saturated truth tables
      (thanks to Michael Baumgartner for the suggestion)
    o Fixed: minor bug in when dealing with a single column PI chart
      (thanks to Michael Baumgartner and Martyna Swiatczak for the report)
      
Version 3.8
    o New: package QCA now accepts unquoted strings for SOP expressions,
      as well as to specify the outcome and conditions, in functions:
      findRows(), generate(), makeChart(), minimize(), modelFit(), pof(),
      pofind(), superSubset(), truthTable() and XYplot()
    o New: implemented a custom version of lpSolve to find exact disjunctive
      solutions for very large and sparse PI charts
    o Fixed: bug in XYplot() when using a vector produced by fuzzyor()
      (thanks to Ian Greener for the report)
    o Fixed: bug affecting the case names in the parameters of fit when
      excluding remainders (thanks to Ian Greener for the report)
    o Fixed: bug leading to a C error when simplifying assumptions do not exist
      for some intermediate models (thanks to Oliver Klein for the report)
    o Changed: function minimize() now gives an error when including remainders
      but all possile configurations are observed
    o Changed: reverted back to using the easy counterfactuals method for the
      intermediate solution, since it is not always possible to restrict it
      to a single model (thanks to Max Netherworlds for the example)
    o Changed: notation for multi-value conditions now uses square brackets
      instead of curly brackets, but the later are still recognized
    o Changed: the sufficiency and necessity relations are now denoted using
      the simpler notation -> and <- instead of => and <=

Version 3.7
    o New: useful functions added to the companion package admisc, among which
      one called invert() that changes a SOP to a POS expression and back
      (thanks to Charles Ragin for the suggestion)
    o New: function generate() for the corresponding data of an arbitrary data
      generating structure (DGS), supplied as a SOP expression
    o Changed: major modification (and *not* backwards compatible) relative to
      denoting negations. Using upper and lower case letters for presence and
      absence is no longer supported, a tilde being the only and the default
      method to signal a negation (thanks to Charles Ragin for making the point)
    o Changed: argument "all.sol" no longer deactivates argument "min.pin", as
      they can be combined to find all PIs that minimally solve the PI chart,
      but not all PIs. The "min.pin" argument without "all.sol" will find only
      the simpler PIs that minimally solve the chart, with increased speed.
    o Changed: removed deprecated argument "use.tilde" from all functions
    o Changed: minimization output now always uses a star sign "*" to denote a
      conjunction, even when the conditions are single letters
    o Changed: argument "exclude" was moved from function minimize() to function
      truthTable()
    o Changed: all printing classes to avoid possible namespace collision with
      package admisc, where a number of functions were moved
    o Changed: printing minimization objects no longer display the truth table
      but only the parameters of fit, when argument "details" is activated
      (thanks to Christian Rupietta for the suggestion)
    o Changed: dialogs for truth table and minimization in the GUI, to reflect
      the current changes
    o Improved: new method of deriving the intermediate solution, without
      using any counterfactuals. This restricts the intermediate solution
      to only one model for each combination of conservative and parsimonious
      models
    o Improved: error messages for function calibrate()
      (thanks to Karen Elliott for the suggestion)
    o Improved: function findRows() now also work with negated truth tables
      (thanks to Ian Greener for the suggestion)
    o Fixed: segmentation fault for extremely complex PI charts
      (thanks to Albert Chiu and Yiqing Xu for the report)

Version 3.6
    o Solved bug related to starting the Graphical User Interface, which
      failed to load the required package admisc

      and simplify() moved to package admisc, with no visible effects on
      the users' side

Version 3.5

      (thanks to Carsten Schneider for insisting)
    o Improved: function simplify() now able to solve even further
      simplifications, using a method advanced by Quine
    o Improved: to avoid infinite running times for very complex PI charts,
      only the first exact solution is returned, with a warning message
      (thanks to Konan Seny Kan for the example)
      
Version 3.4
    o New: function findRows() gains a three dots argument "..." to allow
      passing a combination of cutoff values to function truthTable() for
      the negation of the outcome

    o Improved: function superSubset() gives a better error message when
      no combinations are left given all cutoff values, including ron.cut and
      pri.cut (thanks to Carsten Schneider for the suggestions)
    o Improved: function simplify() now able to solve further simplifications
      such as A + ~AB into A + B (via A + AB + ~AB)
    o Improved: uniform QMC solutions from all minimization methods, with
      no negative configurations, and including remainders
    o Improved: function pofind() now accepts multivalue data
      (thanks to Hanieh Moshki for the suggestion)
    o Fixed: long overdue bug (dating from version 1.0-0) that incorrectly
      identified the easy counterfactuals for some directional expectations
      involving multiple values
    o Fixed: bug in printing the cases, when they contain multi-byte
      characters (thanks to Stefan Verweij for the report)
    o Changed: function sop() renamed to simplify()
    o Changed: all C level functions are now renamed using a "C_" prefix,
      to avoid a namespace overlap with the main R functions
    
Version 3.3
    o New: function calibrate() now accepts method = "TFR" to calibrate
      ordinal values using the Totally Fuzzy and Relative method
    o Improved: relation between Include and Exclude switches in the
      graphical user interface

      simplify the result, where it can be simplified
      (thanks to Macartan Humphreys for the suggestion)
    o Fixed: minor bug leading to an error in truthTable() function,
      for data with a single truth table configuration
      (thanks to Ingo Rohlfing for the report)
    o Fixed: error in the GUI, when exporting a dataset
      (thanks to Ranajoy Choudhury for the report)
    o Changed: argument "tilde" in function factorize() renamed to
      "use.tilde", making it uniform accross functions
    o Changed: relaxed the error about the 0.5 values in the fuzzy data
      from the truthTable() function, to a warning
    o Updated: the latest versions of the jQuery and jQuery-UI in the
      graphical user interface
    
Version 3.2
    o New: dramatically improved function to solve the prime implicants
      chart (using Petrick's method), hundreds of times faster when
      searching for all solutions
    o New: function pofind(), to calculate quick parameters of fit for
      atomic conditions (thanks to Alessia Damonte for the suggestion)
    o Improved: the minimization object now prints only the unique
      intermediate solutions, adding all combinations of conservative and
      parsimonious solutions that produced each unique intermediate one

    o Improved: the function pof() no longer throws an error when the data
      object is a tibble instead of a native R data frame
    o Improved: function translate() now tries harder to throw an error
      message when the expression specifies conditions using both lower and
      upper case letters (e.g. "ConD" instead of "cond" or "COND")
    o Changed: argument "min.pin" in function minimize() is now inactive
      by default
    o Fixed: bug in compute() when the expression and the column names in
      the data simultaneously contain both lower and upper case letters

      fuzzyand() function (thanks to Alessia Damonte for the report)
    o Fixed: bug in XYplot() that prevented calculating parameters of fit
      when the input is a vector of class "fuzzy" generated by fuzzyand()
      or fuzzyor() functions (thanks to Alessia Damonte for the report)
    o Fixed: bug in modelFit() that incorrectly assigned numbers to models

Version 3.1
    o New: spinning wheel in the web R console when calculations take a
      long time
    o Improved: faster version of getRow() that help speeding up finding the
      simplifying assumptions

      separation between the configurations and the parameters of fit
    o Improved: better documentation, including the HTML version from the GUI 
    o Improved: functions fuzzyand() and fuzzyor() gain two new arguments called
      "na.rm" (indicating to remove missing values) and "use.tilde", to signal
      negations when constructing attribute expressions

      contradictory simplifying assumptions and simultaneous subset relations
    o Changed: objects of class "fctr" now have class "factorize"
    o Changed: objects of class "deMorgan" are now proper character vectors instead of
      lists containing these vectors

    o Changed: the argument "data" in function minimize() is renamed to "input"
      (but still backwards compatible)
    o Changed: argument "omit" from function minimize() renamed to "exclude"
    o Changed: simplified function minimize(), the following arguments are dropped
      but still backwards compatible: outcome, conditions, incl.cut, show.cases,

      function truthTable(), to which they are sent anyways; in addition, arguments
      relation and explain did not have any real use
    o Changed: crisp calibration now include the thresholds values in the upper
      groups, to maintain backwards compatibility and be consistent with the
      default function findInterval() which now crisp calibration employs. Users
      who actually want to _exclude_ the thresholds from the upper groups, should
      simply set them to an upper value (thanks to Yan Turgeon for the report).
    o Changed: function deMorgan() renamed to negate()

    o Fixed: minor bug in the web GUI, the data editor did not display the
      correct cell value on double click, when scrolling horizontally

    o Improved: for boolean expressions only (not multivalue), the function 
      translate() now allows duplicated set names in the same product
    o Removed: argument "include" from function calibrate(): it only applied to 
      the crisp calibration, and did not have any practical advantage, users could 
      simply move the threshold one more (lower or upper) value.
    o Removed: argument "add" from function pof(), both PRI and RoN are now 
      formally included in the output.
    o Removed: arguments "prod.split" and "complete" from function deMorgan().
    o Changed: argument "dep" in function retention(), to "dependent".
    o Changed: argument "row.no" in function findSubsets(), to "input".
    o Changed: argument "maximum" in function findSubsets(), to "stop".
    o Changed: argument "input.combs" in function findSupersets(), to "input".
    o Changed: argument "type" in function calibrate() is now "fuzzy" by default
    o Fixed: a situation when all directional expectations are "don't cares", and 
      the intermediate solutions should be identical to the parsimonious solutions
      (thanks to Carsten Schneider for reporting)
    o Fixed: a bug giving an error for a non-calibrated original dataset, when the
      minimized object was already produced by truthTable()

    o Fixed: server code to avoid duplicating commands in the GUI console
    o Fixed: plot window in the GUI did not reopen after close

      value of argument "distm" to "euclidean", in the function findTh()
    o Improved: for argument sort.by in function truthTable(), it is now possible 
      to use "+" and "-" to signal "increasing" or "decreasing"
    o Improved: splitting strings now possible using "+" and "-" to signal
      "increasing" or "decreasing", when using sort.by in function truthTable()
    o Fixed: an outstanding bug assigning cases from truth table rows to solution,
      when subsetting based on the frequency threshold (thanks to Nena Oana and
      Carsten Schneider for the report)
    o Fixed: diagonal and middle guides in XYplot were drawing outside of the plot
      region when using multiple plots in the same graphics device
    o Fixed: bug in the GUI version of calibrate(), when switching from fuzzy to
      crisp it preserved the names of the thresholds and triggered an error

      both thresholds "incl.cut1" and "incl.cut0" to code the outcome as "1" or "C",
      in function truthTable()
    o Changed: binomial inference testing for function pof(), both one-tailed tests
      now have the alternative hypothesis "greater".
    o Changed: default value of argument "hclustm" to "ward.D2", and default

      backwards compatible. Negation of the outcome is detected by a "~" sign
      in front of the outcome name
    o Changed: complete rewrite of the factorize() function, now orders of magnitude
      faster for very complex inputs and producing more accurate results; it also
      automatically detects the product split, if a "*"
    o Improved: deMorgan() can also return products of sums
    o Improved: pof() function now accepts a SOP expression, in addition to current
      functionality
