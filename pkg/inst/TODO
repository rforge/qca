- make pof() accept string expressions like "A*B + C => D" and calculate parameters of fit
- function deMorgan(): negate set-theoretic expressions with multivalent variables
- minimization for multiple outcomes that are not conditions
- inference-statistical tests for fuzzy sets (check paper by Bear Braumoeller and Eliason and Stryker)
- add argument to eqmcc for specifying temporal order
- sensitivity diagnostics (include function "perturb")
- reconstruct developed normal functions from normal functions (call it "develop")
